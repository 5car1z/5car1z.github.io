<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away… There was the Jukebox. Hailed by carebears as an integral cog in the EVE online experience, shunned by leet space bushido pvper’s as an unnecessary factor in the way of the pew, and ridiculed by satirists everywhere as an object of non-existence (hence my familiar title). </p>
<p>This portion of the ye olde EVE UI I speak of allowed pilots to control the thematic and at times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iKA2wJp97s" target="_blank" rel="external">beautiful</a> music created by CCP RealX upon EVE’s early development. Tracks of which players came to know and get all nostalgic over when blared out at max volume, whilst cruising around. </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>You could as expected (or remembered) listen to the tracks in order, randomise them if you preferred, create your own playlist, or just play your favourite piece over and over again until you find yourself humming it out loud at 3:00 AM in the morning, much to the annoyance of others.  </p>
<p>However In 2013 this feature was (to a <em>mixed</em> reception) removed from the game by CCP to make way for a new adaptive soundscape in its place. So why is it that today two years later “<em>sound</em>“ in EVE has continued largely to be considered by numerable players as a non-entity. Its credence limited perhaps to effects rather than the once more highly appreciated music. </p>
<p>We can still hear the <em>classic</em> “EVE has sound?” joke whenever the matter of audio is brought up, but is this just a recurring comedic cliche vets hold onto. Or is the sound of EVE still not up to scratch, a shadow of its former self, and above all else, does anyone even care?  </p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Who-Cares"><a href="#Who-Cares" class="headerlink" title="Who Cares?"></a>Who Cares?</h1><p>Let’s start by being clear and honest about this, it’s not really one of the most pressing issues in EVE. Or a particularly crucial one to EVE as a whole. There’s a very lengthy albeit debatable list of things that we’d likely all agree should come much higher up on the ladder, that need attending to before this jukebox business comes into play. Sovereignty and structures of course come to mind and are fresh in our heads at present.  </p>
<p>The sound of EVE as an all encompassing element though I’d say ranks somewhere higher than we might first realise. In other games or media it’s considered a core aspect of the product, and adds a great deal to the experience in question. Often winning awards or accolades for its addition to the game’s worldliness.</p>
<p>So do people despite this tradition care in the case of EVE? And how has the new soundscape system actually performed two years on. Well… It seems there are some who do care and have things to say about it. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This thirty-seven page thread in the above link on the official forums contains players who want the old jukebox system re-instating, or some new iteration of it in its place. With feedback and contemptuous remarks about the new system I dubbed <em>soundscape</em> earlier on offer. </p>
<p>The latest post in this thread was quite recent in relation to the time of writing this post (2015-03-18). Which surprised me as it means either some players haven’t moved on or just simply think it still needs returning over the current system. So it’s not exactly something these players have forgotten or let go, even if their counterparts will confine their views to opinions of the misinformed, and aren’t really bothered.  </p>

<p>There’s more! The wonderful denizens of /r/eve on Reddit display their own thoughts on the jukebox’s absence and our new soundscape we find ourselves enveloped in (or not as the case may be). </p>
<p>Click the previous link to see <strong>one</strong> of a significant number of these “<em>Bring Back Jukebox or Riot</em>“ threads and their contents. </p>

<p>It would seem at least to me that there is a missed opportunity here for renovation or some form of reconciliation, and that there are those in the player base who still care quite strongly about the thing, and the state of EVE’s sound in general.  </p>
<p>But can the newer updated replaced soundscape be as lackluster as these sources claim?</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="The-Muscape"><a href="#The-Muscape" class="headerlink" title="The Muscape"></a>The Muscape</h1><p>The second question I asked was how has the new sound implementation faired since its introduction. Personally I think it’s had a very shallow impact thus far. Perhaps excluding effects that aren’t inclusive to the jukebox like pew pew lasers, guns, explosions, which appear to be vastly improved/improving, and have come along way. </p>
<p>I’ll try and explain why I think this in the rest of this section by examining the devblog that heralded the change. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/73569" target="_blank" rel="external">INTRODUCING TEAM KLANG!</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the new <em>muscape’s</em> intentions and merits as a replacement system are included in the last link above from a concise devblog written by CCP t0rfifrans two years ago. </p>
<p>So let’s examine the current state of the “muscape” two years on. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Placing all of the 69 songs currently in EVE on Soundcloud”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of removing the jukebox these songs are now available on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ccpgames/" target="_blank" rel="external">CCP’s Soundcloud page</a>, and this is the provided workaround for those missing the Jukebox’s functionality.</p>
<p>I like this in fairness as an idea because they could have just said “it’s gone, deal with it” and they didn’t. On the other hand though I can’t help but think this is reminiscent of passing the book, and deferring the duty of providing a quality sound experience for the game. it’s certainly very external and not that integral i.e. outside of the client. Making it not feel part of the equation if the player’s adopt this method rather than the new muscape feature.  </p>
<p>I’m also sadly finding it hard to treasure the obscure pitch alteration on the in-game tracks that are applied depending upon certain system factors, mainly because if I’m being honest… I usually don’t even notice the difference. </p>
<p>If this was a good idea wouldn’t it have a noticeable effect on the player? I’m told speed is varied too as part of this which you can hear in the next two clips. </p>
<p>For your own comparison:</p>

<p><strong>“If thy jukebox offends thee, hack it off”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He points out that it would take much needed development time from other areas of the game, to continue supporting the jukebox, and that the code base would benefit in terms of maintainability with its removal. </p>
<p>Which sounds fair really. I wonder now in mid 2015 with the new release cycle in place if there’s room for this to slowly grow again as a feature to consider. After things like sovereignty and structures are advanced as we mentioned earlier. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Removing the jukebox and playing music based on where you are”</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know how vast EVE is and it’s packed full of stars. In my relatively short time in EVE I’ve managed to venture past a probably unhealthy number of these stars and their systems (see below image). </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GkQTPFp.png" alt="System&#39;s I&#39;ve Visited"></p>
<p>This is by no means anywhere even close to all of them or the majority in existence, but is a biased mix of highsec, lowsec, nullsec, and the not shown wormhole space. So evidently this is where I’ve been in-game at some point, often repeatedly. But for the life of me I couldn’t tell you what tracks play where or how much of an epic experience the muscape made my playing there. </p>
<p>To summarise another issue in one sentence. </p>
<p><em>I get the same song(s) over and over again.</em> </p>
<p>A large portion of the tracks I swear I haven’t even heard once since the new system was implemented. So my thoughts with this are simply why is the sound NOT having a beneficial effect on the experience, when I get around New Eden like a cheap Minmatar carebear whore enough for it to do so. </p>
<p>Wormhole space I’d say is the worst offender. It’s very harrowing and isolating as the music should be to match the context, but fatally far too repetitive. I’m convinced it’s just one song, and this in particular makes me understand why most players turn sound off (I do when I’m there!). </p>
<p>Maybe I just need to get out more as they say… To hear the other dozens of songs I’m not hearing. My only concern with this is that I’ve heard this exact complaint from a variety of capsuleers, many a time. Which to me implies it’s not having the effect it’s intended to. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Soft soundscape when entering the ingame map”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No complaints really, the ambience with this is nice. Good stuff. It’s not all bad!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The playing experience”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the core of the problem, and I think many other people’s dismay here. There isn’t enough of one when it comes to sound currently.  </p>
<p>As a collective for whatever reason the current sound system is not reaching the potential it could, and the “playing experience” is in turn suffering. Which might explain why people want the jukebox feature back or to turn sound off entirely. </p>
<p>More delving into Reddit in regards to the current state of this system yields results reinforcing notions similar to these, both serious and humorous:</p>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> There are 74 songs in total from the original soundtrack &amp; jukebox now on CCP’s Soundcloud page, yet all I hear in-game is the aptly named <em>But Still We Go On</em>. </p>

<p>Admittedly it’s not an easy task. The hunt goes on for a satisfactory breakthrough plus balance in terms of overall sound for CCP and their crew. </p>
<p>As it’s not seemingly super important and notably will take development time. Maybe all we can do is ride out the storm. After all so far I’ve not really provided any obvious solution or spark of genius on how to fix the problem, only what it possibly could be. </p>
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/201706419&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>The one solution I can think of to start with though is to either bring back the jukebox completely revamped. Containing new functionality and purpose, or alternatively go back to the drawing board with the current sound system. As it leaves much to be desired. </p>
<p>Also I do not think there is enough usage of the update release songs we hear all too briefly. Perhaps we could add the new theme tracks to the jukebox if it does end up returning. As they seem far too short lived and frequent for anyone to get attached to them, or even have reason to listen to again at any point.  </p>
<p>I have to say though, short of these two things I’m at a loss for ideas.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Jukebox-or-Riot"><a href="#Jukebox-or-Riot" class="headerlink" title="Jukebox or Riot"></a>Jukebox or Riot</h1><p>So does EVE have sound? Well it did once, sort of… And hopefully it will once again someday. Where the people who don’t acknowledge its existence have no choice but to, as it will be a much more integral part of the experience. </p>
<p>What we need here perhaps is something old something new, so to speak. A system that emphasises EVE’s gloriously rich soundscape of old, and not the new underwhelmingly insufficient muscape one, to put it bluntly. </p>
<p>In regards specifically to the jukebox. I don’t really care whether it returns or not, despite any sentimentality. What I care for is something better than the current rendition of sound in EVE making an entry. As it doesn’t seem all that impressive in mine and multiple other’s experience. </p>
<p>If you agree with these sentiments then show your support on the thread from earlier, and let CCP know what you think. </p>
<p>I’ll link it again here:</p>
