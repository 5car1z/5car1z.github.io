<h1 id="Preamble"><a href="#Preamble" class="headerlink" title="Preamble"></a>Preamble</h1><p>This post serves as my entry to the Pod and Planet Fiction Contest YC117 this year. The main character featured in this news report style article is taken from a real <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/92526572/" target="_blank" rel="external">EVE capsuleer</a> who’s proficient in the art of internet spaceship insurance fraud.</p>
<p>The content to be considered for judging starts from the next section onwards.</p>

<h1 id="From-Riches-to-Riches"><a href="#From-Riches-to-Riches" class="headerlink" title="From Riches to Riches"></a>From Riches to Riches</h1><p>Our current main offices reside inside the bustling trade hub station of Amarr. Wrecks can be seen littered all over the undock. Nothing new all in all for this station. Further out though lies a capital ship freighter wreck currently being salvaged by several enterprising frigates. CONCORD are examining the remains of this wreck as we write this, as it has obvious signs of modern day ship insurance fraud.</p>
<p>This is however by no means the first time we’ve chosen to report on the steadily growing influx of ship insurance fraud, and if trends continue it will probably not be the last. The sight we’ve seen ourselves in previous articles that new players emerge daily in this game of fraud. Most of them firmly with their eye on the potential ISK up for grabs.</p>
<p>As one of our past fraudulent sources once disclosed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“It’s a dangerous game to play. One that most would never even contemplate playing. You have to be smart, crafty, ready to sacrifice, and always one step ahead of the rarely competent space police.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man known only as <em>Market Tycoon</em> is one of the more recent players of this “dangerous game”. One who has captured the imaginations and hearts of many inside of the public “NPSI” circles. He in the realms of the latter seems to have created something of a minor celebrity for himself.</p>
<p>We managed to get an interview with this mysterious figure to try and catch a glimpse of the underground fraud scene as a whole, and perhaps unravel some of the mystery surrounding his own mysterious character.</p>
<p>For his own security he asked us not to reveal certain details divulged in the interview and that we refrain from quoting him verbatim on several sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Market began by telling us that his background in business made him perfect for the growing crime of ship insurance fraud (on some level). The ISK he earned back then was considerable, even incredible at times when he tried hard enough. Playing the markets he recalled came with its own highs (and lows) but just never quite lived up to his new “profession”. He also joyfully stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Long gone are the days of space spreadsheets and market order one-upmanship.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With which he continued to say; pulling the wool over CONCORD’s eyes and seeing the insurance ISK roll into his wallet provided a feeling like no other. Something he believed was part of the motivation behind the continuation of the ship insurance fraud crime wave. His new calling he explained was one that is infinitely more fulfilling than the last, and he knew others who felt the same.</p>
<p>We speculated with Market for a while that the reasoning behind continual increases of ship insurance fraud is in part also down to the relative ease at which it can be carried out. In most cases Market told us that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“To get started, the prospective fraud artist needs only a willing accomplice and some start-up capital to purchase the ships that are to be sacrificed. A familiarity with the legal system behind kill-rights is also very beneficial.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking this a bit further we asked how many others he knew were involved in crimes of this sort. Market was reluctant to answer at first, but did say there are a group of several others he is familiar with who meet often to discuss the “trade”. Furthermore there have been some he said who came to him for “advice”. Seeking to emulate the actions of those like himself. He was of course not giving out any names.</p>
<p>It is at this point in the interview we attempted to shed light on the esoteric nature of Market’s reputation. We asked the origins of his ambiguous name and why he thought certain capsuleers spoke of him in such romanticised terms. Market immediately displayed to us his pilot’s license. The name on his P.L.E.X really was to our surprise genuinely printed as “Market Tycoon”. Which he believes is what sparked his fanciful almost outlaw like image. That of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“A trader turned rogue against the system, seeking revenge upon the bureaucratic corporate whores who penalised him at every chance they got, in a time gone past.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words not ours.</p>
<p>Most of the image though he admitted to being confined to the public fleet communities familiar with his exploits, and not much further than that.</p>
<p>The interview we had with our source culminated in him affirming his desire to continue playing the system, and emphasised that in reality he was doing nothing wrong. He referred to his actions as being “technically inside the law.” CONCORD naturally of course disagree with this sentiment. As they have stated on many occasions when being forced to respond to unending criticism for their lack of foresight in regulating and maintaining the capsuleer insurance laws. Some of which have only been changed in recent times to cater for issues outside of the scope of this article.</p>
<p>One thing we definitely learned from our brief discussion with Market is that he certainly enjoys this and it is something he does not do out of necessity or dire need. Perhaps most memorably he made clear that even the insurance payout itself was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Just the icing on the starcake.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This interview we conducted with Market leaves us with conflicted views on the subject. On one hand this is clearly some sort of manipulation of the system. Whilst on the other CONCORD seems seriously lacking their responsibility and sheer ability to handle the situation at large.</p>
<p>Regardless we expect this ever growing phenomena to continue to affect New Eden’s space lanes for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p><em>Has you or someone you know been personally affected by insurance fraud? If so please don’t get in touch. Instead send all fraud enquiries directly to CONCORD. Thanks! </em>  </p>

<h1 id="Preamble"><a href="#Preamble" class="headerlink" title="Preamble"></a>Preamble</h1><p>This post serves as my entry to the <a href="http://podandplanet.wix.com/podandplanet" target="_blank" rel="external">Pod and Planet Fiction Contest YC116</a> this year, and is based off of some dubious insurance fraud we keep running into at RvB Ganked, every week without fail. One of the two main characters featured is taken from a real EVE capsuleer who’s responsible for said fraud. Check out <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/90452671/" target="_blank" rel="external">Vhuby Tenku’s killboard</a> for my inspiration on writing this. Hope you enjoy, the content to be considered for judging starts from the next section onwards.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Discourteous-Freighter-Fraud"><a href="#Discourteous-Freighter-Fraud" class="headerlink" title="Discourteous Freighter Fraud"></a>Discourteous Freighter Fraud</h1><p>Treyas began yawning heavily as the real-time monitor displayed his client’s name and case code ID. A depressingly familiar sight for the increasingly destitute space lawyer. He was early as usual, but lost in thought. </p>
<p>“What am I gonna conjure up this time round… Same as last time I guess.” He thought to himself.</p>
<p>His client Vhuby moped into the lobby wearing clothes fit for an Amarrian dissenter’s brothel. The disheartened lawyer waved discretely in her general direction, as she also began starring at the now pulsating monitor. A vibrantly highlighted label stated the word “OVERDUE” on the screen.</p>
<p>Shortly after a representative quickly ushered the two into a court room, and a recitation in the rules of etiquette whilst “justice was in motion” began. Vhuby knew this self indulgent tripe off by heart. As this wasn’t the first time she’d been in such a predicament, this was in fact the same room, and station within Kemerk as before.</p>
<p>“Vhuby Tenku, capsuleer of Garoun Investment Bank, once again we find ourselves convening on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“Hey I didn’t want to be here either but they said I had to attend again!”</p>
<p>“Despite being brought upon these charges for the thirteenth time running you are still unaware that it is not yet your turn to speak… and, that I had not finished. Not by a long shot.”</p>
<p>“Who are you again?” Vhuby openly mused. </p>
<p>“As you well know I am Judge Vhiskas, the same official assigned to your miserable case as countless times before. I too have no wish to be in your company once again Miss Tenku. Yet I am obliged to participate by duty and honour… Eman give me strength.” </p>
<p>Vhiskas went on at great length as to how Vhuby now had twenty-six charges of insurance fraud brought to her name, of which thirteen were classified as capital size Freighter incidents. With a ludicrous grand total of 28.26 billion ISK claimed over her self described “very unfortunate, badly timed accidents”. The Judge made clear their side were not convinced or even amused as to her explanations, and that there would also be no remorse as soon as tangible proof had presented itself.</p>
<p>Vhuby really couldn’t give a trits worth of what they thought. As in truth, although she appeared dim-witted, un-interested, and asleep at times (which quite often she was). Her mind was that of an intergalactic fraud artist with such cunning, that you could host a “bonus room” with her and get away with it. Vhuby was however (regardless of her fraudulent intentions) a mildly ethical space citizen, and kept clear of anything that did not involve harassing the living implants out of her beloved CONCORD officials… if they had any.</p>
<p>Vhiskas came to the end of his dramatic rhetoric, and facing Vhuby he continued by saying.</p>
<p>“Well, my most despised of capsuleers. We have on this occasion been privy to the black box recording of your latest accident. Let’s take a look shall we…”</p>
<p>Footage played out of Vhuby piloting a brand new rusty Fenrir, and openly conversing with a fleet of RvB Ganked pilots in her local chat channel. Begging for someone to activate the self imposed kill right so she could “Claim da insurance ISKies to get high n fly”.</p>
<p>This time, things did not look optimistic. Treyas’s already slave like expression dropped even further for all in the room to see. Indicating subconsciously to everyone that he knew his work was now cut out for him, even more so than previously. </p>
<p>Vhuby however did not care, nor was she paying attention. For she was glaring incessantly at her Neocom. Viewing what Treyas could only briefly make out as an outrageously expensive ‘Rocket’ dress on the NeX Store. He stood in silence for a moment whilst face palming dejectedly, only to mouth quietly “We’re so fucked”.</p>
<p>Buy some time, he thought. </p>
<p>“Judge, I require a moment of sanctioned time to liaise with my client here.”</p>
<p>The judge sat down comfortably, satisfied knowing now he at last had the proof he needed to put an end to this out right disregard and mockery of CONCORD’s well devised laws.</p>
<p>“Look Vhuby, this time you’ve fucked it up completely.” he whispered forcefully.</p>
<p>“Whilst you were shopping on your Neocom they’ve shown the black box recording from that last kill-right activation gank. This is the binding evidence they need to put you away for good! </p>
<p>“Wait what?” She replied. “I must have forgotten to hack it last time” Vhuby dismay-fully let on.</p>
<p>A desolate silence ensued, interrupted only by a stroke of unexpected brilliance from Treyas. Somehow from the back of his overburdened mind, he had remembered service order number 1337. This questionable legislation prohibited use of any local chat channel content as evidence, not within the sovereignty of CONCORD itself.</p>
<p>Vhiskas spent far too long checking the archive for this “1337” legislation, but eventually to his utter bewilderment and despair found it to be valid. Treyas was in fact correct. Leaving Vhiskas with no choice but to issue a severe caution to Vhuby, personally promising her eventual downfall, but that she was free to go.</p>
<p>The now wealthy space lawyer checked his flashing wallet balance, Vhuby had deposited a sum of 300 million ISK into the account. With the tagline “Thanks again scrublord! ♥” amended to the payment. Peacefully he gazed out onto an adjacent undocking area through the large station window. At ease and relieved by his recent constitutional brain wave. </p>
<p>He would have savoured this moment longer, if his eye had not caught the already structure tanking Adrestia hurtling off the undock. Well out of docking range, with Vhuby as its suspect status pilot. Four Tengu’s were already in flight chasing the Adrestia, ready to read their forthcoming insurance enabling kill mail.</p>
<p>Treyas looked on in despair, swallowed a blue pill booster, and laughed heartily whilst mumbling to himself “I’ll pencil her in for next week then”.</p>
