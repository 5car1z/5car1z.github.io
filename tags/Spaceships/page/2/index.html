<h1 id="Connections-V"><a href="#Connections-V" class="headerlink" title="Connections V"></a>Connections V</h1><p>Attendees within Spectre will often bring up the topic of “Ganked” shortly before the weekend, encouraging others to come along and witness another groups rendition of organised fun. I was always aware previously of the emphasis placed upon community in EVE but never to the extent of that which it actually goes. An aspect that even now still never fails to surprise me, even though I’m a lot more accustomed to it. </p>
<p>Here’s what <em>went down</em> at some of the Gankeds I attended this summer, so to speak.</p>

<p>Carrying on with the connections vibe here the FC running the show on this occasion came from Spectre (Ashurman), I waffled on about some of his endeavors in a <a href="http://www.tricksofthetrades.net/2014/10/25/summer-in-space-1/">previous post</a>. It’s safe to say his event themes are never routine and always a bit eccentric. In this case it was armor kiting assault frigates, a concept that came prefaced with two key phrases “<em>shudup its a great idea!”</em> and “DRUGS WILL BE AVAILABLE”. What this says about the FC / Ganked organisers I won’t comment on, I’ll just let you the discerning capsuleer decide, but this I was up for.</p>
<p>My main memory of the event is is an odd one. Friendly fire smartbombing seems to crop up as an issue from time to time on these fleets, and is usually dealt with as fairly as possible, if there’s time. In this instance there was enough to do so, and the verdict was death by beam laser squad. Young Kanon’s execution was swift, calculated, and epilepsy inducing to say the least. The grand irony to be noted here is the ship he was in at the time, see below. All in all this was my first Ganked experience, and it’s safe to say it didn’t disappoint.  </p>

<p>After coming away pretty high off of the last Ganked event, I set sail with optimism on this one. Everyone warmed up by helping settle some <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/41374251/" target="_blank" rel="external">insurance problems</a> a freighter pilot had. Might wanna look into that CONCORD.</p>
<p>We then moved onto the real stuff which began with us dicking around in PL’s back yard. They took notice and things eventually culminated in us getting absolutely wrecked. Taken to Wrexham and back again is the phrase I believe, if you live in her majesty’s fine wet and windy nation. Despite this it was a nice little brawl (massacre) and we were grateful towards them for bringing a realistic engagement profile against our frigate themed gang. </p>
<p>Shortly after this we picked up some reinforcements in the form of my past french amis near Mormelot, which was a nice touch for me and slightly nostalgic. Then after a bit of slow motion epic gate travelling, we swung round near another of my old homes in Placid, and ambushed an unsuspecting gate camp. I would summarise this clash as nothing other than swagtastic, if that’s even a word (it is now).</p>

<p>Feeling quite pleased with ourselves we ventured down the pipe into Cal Mill / Gal Mill (probably Gall…) faction warfare space, to take up the offer of fighting Overload Everything. When we got there we nonchalantly warped to the “meeting point” only to realise it was a trap, or “tarp” if you prefer. Complete with the ever so fashionable smartbombing.   </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8ZFvhNf.gif" alt="Tarp!"></p>
<p>Still slightly bitter from the prior ambush, retreat, and loss, we went after a consolation prize in the form of Chessur in a nightmare. Floating joyously but catastrophically off of a gate. For all to whore on. Perhaps he thought he was in a stealth bomber as usual, or just really, really, really, had to go afk. Check out his blog if you like cloaking, bombs, stalking, whips, chains, and all the rest.</p>

<p>Conveniently now I was back home in northern FW space, which rounded off the occasion nicely. This event in general goes down as my favourite in EVE so far I think. Mostly as I was lucky enough to have my own background narrative going with all the locations and players we encountered, a trip down memory lane you might say. Along with of course some swagtastically good fights…</p>

<h1 id="Ganked-136-Magnitude"><a href="#Ganked-136-Magnitude" class="headerlink" title="Ganked 136: Magnitude"></a>Ganked 136: Magnitude</h1><p>By now we were guilty of insurance fraud on <a href="https://zkillboard.com/kill/41616037/" target="_blank" rel="external">multiple counts</a>, nonetheless it was still a welcome start to the evening’s debaucheries.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, apart from all these intricate links players have to one and other within the game, that often serve well when generating content. There’s a significant other positive to be found here. I touched upon it in the <a href="http://www.tricksofthetrades.net/2014/10/25/summer-in-space-1/">previous Spectre Fleet post</a>. These events like Ganked educate players on how best to PvP, or failing that, how not to. They can also be an opportunity to try new things. In my case this was to begin learning how to Logi on an alt. Besides, sometimes the deep end is a good place to learn, if there are others there who can help keep you afloat.   </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MfiVXdu.png" alt="Ruptures On Gate"></p>
<p>Analogies and education aside, this event was host to a Psychotic Tendencies (TISHU) battleship fleet fight, complete with triage carrier support. Ganked members piloted artillery Ruptures and gave no fucks when cynos went up, as when you go on these roams you should not expect to return with your ship (This is the game in a nutshell really). Although pretty intense for however long it lasted. Our numbers and or magnificent skills, won us the fight! With much praise from fleet mates on our top notch repping duties (Logi on killmails anyone?).</p>

<p>My next attempt at Logi came in the form of Apex Aubaris’s “Baltech” doctrine. Apocs, Megathrons, Tempests, Guardians, and the like. The intention was to provide content for Bacchanalian’s charity event and take on the other kind space folk groups involved. Things got off to a slow start initially as the server cluster was experiencing some form of tech problem, not to mention our self-generated TiDi. Exhausted hamsters, data centre mutiny, DDOS, could have literally been anything, I’m not going to try and guess which one.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KNrXXgq.png" alt="Apex Force"></p>
<p>With all systems up and running again and around an estimated 500 jumps later, we arrived in time for the buffet. CCP had laid on quite the spread with the Nyx and her dreadnought friends, and were even there themselves to converse with us in local. Not long after there was to top if off, a killmail for the Nyx. Yes I’m still sour about the Revenant, and in terms of my Logi experience, after getting to grips with the art of cap chaining. I didn’t screw up too much, and was in turn hopefully “credit to team”. </p>
<p>Bacchanalian and his donators reached the agreed target causing CCP to contribute another $5,000 to the cause, and Apex who FC’d his implants off, was awarded a prestigious limited edition gold monocle for his patience and bravery in the line of NPSI duty. OP success, killboard green, charity aided.</p>

<p>All I’ll add again is the prevalence of community and the enjoyment provided by these NPSI events for the player base. Winter is coming, but Ganked is always coming too. Even in new flavours like <a href="http://mangala.rvbganked.co.uk/spin-off/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ganked Ultra</a> (lewd innuendo and puns thoroughly intended). </p>

<h1 id="Personal-Background"><a href="#Personal-Background" class="headerlink" title="Personal Background"></a>Personal Background</h1><p>I’ve been in and out of EVE since 2010, mostly due to RL reasons, other games, and sometimes an admitted pure lack of motivation to log in and play. Despite this I’ve always appreciated the unique aspects of the game, even in comparison to many others of its kind. I think it’s initially these things that kept me returning again and again. The latest return seems somewhat more permanent than previously. As it’s becoming more and more apparent that you don’t really leave this game, you just go afk. </p>
<p>Myself and a friend decided to create alts with the sole purpose of PvP this time round, as we had dabbled before, but not nearly enough. It was in our early days with these new chars that we stumbled upon the Spectre Fleet channel, and the addiction began.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<hr>
<h1 id="Randy-Rifters"><a href="#Randy-Rifters" class="headerlink" title="Randy Rifters"></a>Randy Rifters</h1><iframe width="1070" height="500" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OR3Joxg3cd8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The first ever public fleet we attended was dubbed Randy Rifters, and run by “FC of our hearts” Ashurman, and consisted of as many rifters as could be amassed in support of harassing the fun loving residents of Providence. Or anyone unfortunate enough to be in the region at that time. This was by no means a one off incident, and is a common occurrence in Spectre’s hunt for content.   </p>
<p>We were at first surprised to be provided with free rifter hulls and fits, as in a sandbox environment such as EVE, notions of this type are a tad unheard of. Especially in comparison to the more advertised selfish aspects of EVE like theft or scamming. Moreover, we ended up having one hell of a time participating (kill whoring) in the action packed roam. One that would keep us coming back again and again for more. To this day our first Spectre roam is likely the most fun I’ve had in EVE thus far, perhaps mirrored only by an RvB Ganked event at a later date.</p>
<p>So for the rest of the summer, far too many times than I can remember, we took part in anal atrons, kinky kestrels, cocky condors, bloomin breachers, many more splendidly named ships, and the odd spot of high-sec suicide ganking. Also quite importantly we were shown the basic mechanics of EVE’s PvP in a nullsec environment, moving from epic fails to more minor fails as time went on (progress!). We even learnt on multiple occasions how not to fly stealth bombers, thanks to CVA’s more than optimistic bombing runs. </p>

<p>Ashurman took one of Spectre’s classic cruiser doctrines to this event and promptly began wiping the skybox with a suspiciously suspect Talwar gang. Several entities from all across EVE turned up to fight and for a chance to get on the super-carrier killmail. This event was also one of my first real encounters with the deadly force of time dilation, or TiDi for short. Remember to always stick to the official code when making your FC aware of this oncoming hazard (FC 10:40).</p>
<p>Eventually PL showed up in some very shiny Navy Apocs and a timely yet tactical withdrawal ensued, only temporarily of course in order to find a more sizeable opponent. So despite the fun police’s involvement, I deduce that much fun was had by all at this event (except by the Talwars).</p>

<p>This event saw several of the NPSI communities team up into a considerable force with poor CVA once again acting as the target for hundred’s of violence hungry pubbies. Admittedly it appears I missed out on the real fun of this event, as ironically I exploded to a well timed CVA bombing run, relatively early on, typical…</p>

<p>This event was interesting to say the least. In short a massive brawl took place featuring some of the greatest theory crafted fits of all time (<em>not</em>) although the only incidence of this I’ll draw attention to is the spider tanking battle ventures, that i will have you know fucked up several unsuspecting intoxicated victims, before exploding back into the minerals they came from. Much to the delight and perhaps horror of a number of on-looking try-harding theorycrafters. It was safe to say, damn funny. </p>

<p>This event is not as positive as the others here, as those involved will predict. Not sure it matters though as most people reading this have stopped and gone to <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%2Fr%2Feve&amp;l=1" target="_blank" rel="external">/r/eve</a> by now for their daily fix. </p>
<p>Regardless Spectre overlords choose the Gods of War doctrine for our participation in the Revenant massacre. The super-carrier was not the concern that much here though, horrendous latency and the frame thrashing lag of around 5,000 people in one system was. </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s7hbfc2.png" alt="Spectre Canes"></p>
<p>Despite the lag we did manage to kill a Thanatos after what seemed like more than ample time to grow a beard, straight after running into PL Tempest Fleet Issues (literal issues).</p>

<p>There were of course other Spectre events that took place in the summer, some more impromptu in form. But these will have to go unmentioned as there’s so many I might never stop writing. I’m also left wondering what winter will bring for Spectre and their NPSI co-horts. </p>
